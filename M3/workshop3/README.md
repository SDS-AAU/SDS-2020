## Your task today

Develop and train a model based on sequentlial data of your choice.

This can be a:

1: Many-to-one prediction, eg. text-classification, time-series forecast (next period)
2: Many-to-many prediction, eg. sentence completion, time-series forecast (several periods)

Data sources could be: 
   * Stock-market or other trading data
   * interest rates or other maro data
   * Weather or other natural phenomenon data (eg. earthquakes)
   
* Feel free to use kaggle etc notebooks as inspiration.
* Please work in notebooks, and be ready to present your process throughout and at the end of the workshop.
