# Workshop 3: Neural Networks & Sequential data

## Your task today

Develop and train a model based on sequentlial data of your choice.

### This can be a:

1: Many-to-one prediction, eg. text-classification, time-series forecast (next period)
2: Many-to-many prediction, eg. sentence completion, time-series forecast (several periods)

### Data sources could be: 

* Stock-market or other trading data
* interest rates or other maro data
* Weather or other natural phenomenon data (eg. earthquakes)
   
### Challanges ahead:
 
* Find and download appropriate data
* Bring the data into the right shape (eg. rolling origin resampling[^3] for many-to-x timeserioes prediction)

### Comments

* Please work in notebooks, and be ready to present your process throughout and at the end of the workshop.
* Feel free to use kaggle notebooks, Keras documentation etc. as inspiration.[^3]
