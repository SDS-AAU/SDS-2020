# M3 - Deep Learning Workshop 2 - Working with CNNs

Your task today is to build a Hot-dog / not-hotdog classifier using a CNN architecture
You can find the data here: https://storage.googleapis.com/sds-file-transfer/hot-dog-not-hot-dog.zip 

If you prefer to work with other (similar data)

You will get 2 hours to work on that in groups. We're happy to answer questions as you go. The last hour will be used for presentations.

## 1. Build the network
- Build and train a CNN model.
- Evaluate appropriately
- You can use transfer learning if you like

## 2. Model explainability
- Using LIME, try to understand where the model breaks.
